## Welcome to **Robotic Lawn Mower BYO**

###Why this project?

Again it is spring time. It is getting warmer. Flowers are in blossom and the lawn is growing. 

Lawning the mown takes time. Although one can automate this task.

However using a commerical robots lawn mower causes troubles:

- you need to put a wire around the border of you lawn
- cost
- additional infrastructure such as eletricity

Hence here is what I need:
- robotic self-sufficient lawn mower
- can read the lawn and therefore does not need a wire
